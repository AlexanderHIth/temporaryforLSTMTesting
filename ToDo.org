#+title: ToDo
* Ground truth data
** DONE Make ground truth data consistent
** DONE Add /Grasping/ class
** Smoothen the timeseries with splines, then sample 200 data points
** Add more features
*** DONE Objects moving
*** [?] Quaternions
*** Velocity
*** Curvature
*** Torsion
* CRF
** Plot test & validation accuracy
** DONE Train on 3 demonstrations, test on unseen one
** Cross-validation \to train on splits and average metrics results

* HMM
** DONE Check testing on unseen data with HMM
** Plot test & validation accuracy
** DONE Train on 3 demonstrations, test on unseen one
** DONE Convert to batched model
** Cross-validation \to train on splits and average metrics results

* Higher level segmentation
** KILL Get the pixel position of objects across time 
** DONE Convert to binary signals: moving/not moving
** KILL Try Segment Anything or DINOv3, whatever works!
** TODO Need AprilTags
* Discovery of new skills
** Make a fake skill that repeats in test data
** HMM \to get the uncertainty of hidden states
** CRF
*** Implement Bayesian CRF version
*** Get the uncertainty of ~y~ states
* Code
** Make a dataloader?
* Project
** DONE Make features for when the objects move
** Similarity metric to know the name of the class
** Discover new skill from Bayesian uncertainty
