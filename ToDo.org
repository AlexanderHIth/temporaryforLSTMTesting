#+title: ToDo
* Ground truth data
** DONE Make ground truth data consistent
** DONE Add /Grasping/ class
** [?] Smoothen the timeseries with splines, then sample 200 data points
** Add more features
*** DONE Objects moving
*** [?] Quaternions
*** Velocity
*** Curvature
*** Torsion
** DONE Try making the data simpler
*** [X] Remove fork & spoon
Okay-ish \to 70%
*** KILL Simplify gripper multi stairs into a single 0/1 binary signal
*** [X] Try to simplify the ground truth to only 2 segments
Works!
*** Break the signal into 5 repetitions and learn only the 4 primitives x 5 repetitions x 3 demonstrations (i.e. learn on 50 points instead of 250 and loop on the length of the complete signal)
* CRF
** Plot test & validation accuracy
** DONE Train on 3 demonstrations, test on unseen one
** Cross-validation \to train on splits and average metrics results

* HMM
** DONE Check testing on unseen data with HMM
** Plot test & validation accuracy
** DONE Train on 3 demonstrations, test on unseen one
** DONE Convert to batched model
** Cross-validation \to train on splits and average metrics results

* Higher level segmentation
** KILL Get the pixel position of objects across time 
** DONE Convert to binary signals: moving/not moving
** KILL Try Segment Anything or DINOv3, whatever works!
** Need AprilTags
* Code
** Make a dataloader?
** TODO Plot ground truth on same plot as prediction:
*** as vertical dashed lines on same plots
*** TODO add another axis just for the GT classes
* Project
** DONE Make features for when the objects move
** TODO Similarity metric to know the name of the class
** TODO Discovery of new skills
*** Make a fake skill that repeats in test data
*** HMM \to get the uncertainty of hidden states
*** CRF
**** Implement Bayesian CRF version
**** Get the uncertainty of ~y~ states
