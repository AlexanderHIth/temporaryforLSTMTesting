* CRF
** Plot test & validation accuracy
** DONE Loop testing on all 4 demonstrations & aggregate 4 results
** [?] Train on all 4 demos & test on CV splits?
* HMM
** DONE Check testing on unseen data with HMM
** Plot test & validation accuracy
** TODO Loop testing on all 4 demonstrations & aggregate 4 results
*** TODO Convert to batched model
* Higher level segmentation
** KILL Get the pixel position of objects across time 
** Convert to binary signals: moving/not moving
** KILL Try Segment Anything or DINOv3, whatever works!
** TODO Need AprilTags
* Discovery of new skills
** Make a fake skill that repeats in test data
** HMM \to get the uncertainty of hidden states
** CRF
*** Implement Bayesian CRF version
*** Get the uncertainty of ~y~ states
* Code
** Make a dataloader?
