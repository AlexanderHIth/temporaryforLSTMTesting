# Segmentations utilities

## Data
Download the data from `https://studentuml-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/andrea_pierre_student_uml_edu/Documents/table-task?csf=1&web=1&e=nAn7l5` (need to be granted access first).

## Ground truth segmentation
To get the ground truth segmentation from the demonstrations data, run the following script: `panel serve synchro_video_eef_position.py` to get the frame numbers & timeseries indices between each segment.
